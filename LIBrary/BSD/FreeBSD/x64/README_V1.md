# ProTraApp for FreeBSD 64 bit

This is a set of libraries for ProTraApp compatible with all 64 bit versions of FreeBSD (since the script is very easy to maintain, why not) 

Currently, I have 64 bit support for FreeBSD 5 to FreeBSD 13. 

Script support is currently available in the following programming languages:

1. C (all versions)

And human-spoken languages

1. English (US)
