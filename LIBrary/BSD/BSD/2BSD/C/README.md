# 2 BSD Support error

2BSD is written for the PDP-11. This system is WAY too old for me to develop software for right now, and has an incredibly low marketshare (the computer is a 16 bit microcomputer from 1970 (the first year of the UNIX world, the start of the UNIX epoch) with only 600,000 units sold (mostly to organizations and big companies) and costs well over 12000 USD (even in 1970s money, not counting inflation) it is so limited that application development simply isn't feasible at the moment.

If there is a popular 2BSD virtualization software (an emulator that runs 2BSD) I may reconsider.
