# ProTraApp for MacOS X/OS X/MacOS

This is a set of libraries for ProTraApp compatible with all 32 and 64 bit versions of MacOS (since the script is very easy to maintain, why not) 

Currently, I have 32 and 64 bit support for Mac OS X 10.0 to MacOS 11.3. 

Script support is currently available in the following programming languages:

1. AppleScript (All versions)

2. Objective-C (All versions)

3. Swift (OS X 10.8 and up) I don't know what the first version of Mac OS that Swift will run on is, so I assumed 10.8. Swift support for Mac OS X and iOS is available for MacOS X 10.8 and up, and iOS 6 and up

4. Python 2 (Mac OS X 10.0 to Mac OS X 10.4)

5. Python 3 (Mac OS X 10.5 and up)

And human-spoken languages

1. English (US)
