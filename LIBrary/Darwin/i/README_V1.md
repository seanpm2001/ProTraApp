# ProTraApp for iPhoneOS/iOS/iPadOS

This is a set of libraries for ProTraApp compatible with all 32 and 64 bit versions of iPhoneOS, iOS, and iPadOS (since the script is very easy to maintain, why not) 

Currently, I have 32 and 64 bit support for iPhone OS 1 to iOS 14, and iPadOS 13 to iPadOS 14.

Script support is currently available in the following programming languages:

1. AppleScript (iPhone OS 1-iOS 7)

2. Objective-C (All versions)

3. Swift (iOS 8 and up, iPadOS 13 nad up) I felt like it was better to support AppleScript up to iOS 7, then switch to Swift for iOS 8 and up. 

And human-spoken languages

1. English (US)
