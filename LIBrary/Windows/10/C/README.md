# ProTraApp for Windows 10 C applications

This is a set of libraries for ProTraApp compatible with all 32 and 64 bit versions of Windows 10 (since the script is very easy to maintain, why not) 

Currently, I have 32 and 64 bit support for Windows 10 build 1507 to build 2004. Since the script is pretty universal, it will work on C(19)99 AND UP.

Script support is currently available in the following programming languages:

1. C

And human-spoken languages

1. English (US)
