# ProTraApp for Android 64 bit

This is a set of libraries for ProTraApp compatible with all 64 bit versions of Android (since the script is very easy to maintain, why not) 

Currently, I have 64 bit support for Android 5.0 Lollipop to Android 12.0 developer preview 1.

Script support is currently available in the following programming languages:

1. Java

And human-spoken languages

1. English (US)
