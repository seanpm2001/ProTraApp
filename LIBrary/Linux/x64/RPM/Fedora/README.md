# ProTraApp for Fedora 64 bit

This is a set of libraries for ProTraApp compatible with all 64 bit versions of Fedora (since the script is very easy to maintain, why not) 

Currently, I have 64 bit support for Fedora 8 to Fedora 35. 

Script support is currently available in the following programming languages:

1. C (all versions)

2. C++ (all versions)

3. Python 3 (all versions)

And human-spoken languages

1. English (US)
