# ProTraApp for Fedora 32 bit

This is a set of libraries for ProTraApp compatible with all 32 bit versions of Fedora (since the script is very easy to maintain, why not) 

Currently, I have 32 bit support for Fedora Core 1 to Fedora 12. I am stopping here for now, as version 8 is the first 64 bit release, and version 12 has a 64 bit modification and is the last feature upgrade I want to include for 32 bit Fedora Linux at the moment.

Script support is currently available in the following programming languages:

1. C

And human-spoken languages

1. English (US)

32 bit support for Fedora 13 and up is not happening until after 2038, as I want to help encourage more users to switch to 64 bit UNIX before the [Year 2038 problem occurs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem) simply switching to a 64 bit system is the solution for this problem (note: does not affect Windows users, as Windows is not UNIX Based, but it does affect MacOS. 32 bit Windows has its own problems, like the Year 10000 bug, and 32 bit Windows is becoming less and less common, so it shouldn't be an issue there)
