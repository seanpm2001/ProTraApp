# ProTraApp
ProTraApp (**Pro**gram **Tra**veler **App**lication) is a set of libraries used to creatively link 2 programs of the same universe together. Mainly a game engine plugin, it can also be used for other software and programs.

***

## About

See above. This repository is a [software library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)) that I started developing on March 2nd 2021, although I have had the idea for a number of years before this date.

This library is used to creatively link 2 programs together (not just games, any program on any operating system)

## Software status

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am ussing the abbreviation "Digital Restrictions Management" instead of the more known "Digital Rights Management" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling "Digital Restrictions Management" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.

## Libraries

This project is purely a software library. 

Why is it called `LIBrary` instead of just `lib`? I did this to help new computer users/new programmers better understand what a software library is. The first 3 letters (LIB, the common abbreviation) are capitalized and the rest of the word is lowercase. This is done so people can learn what the abbreviation stands for. This comes from personal experience, when I was learning Python in 2018. I didn't know what lib meant until I looked it up. I want to educate people on computer science, and this method may help people learn the term without even realizing it, so that they are a little bit smarter when they go to other projects.

The library is currently available for Linux, MacOS, and Windows. BSD support is coming soon.

LIBrary/Darwin: for MacOS and iOS:

> AppleScript (All versions)

> Objective-C (All versions)

> Swift (OS X 10.8 and up) I don't know what the first version of Mac OS that Swift will run on is, so I assumed 10.8. Swift support for Mac OS X and iOS is available for MacOS X 10.8 and up, and iOS 6 and up

> Python 2 (Mac OS X 10.0 to Mac OS X 10.4)

> Python 3 (Mac OS X 10.5 and up)

LIBrary/GameEngines: for Game engines

> Unity

> GoDot

LIBrary/Linux

> Linux/x32/Debian/Ubuntu/

> > Ubuntu 4.10 to Ubuntu 10.04, C (programming language) only at the moment.

> Linux/x64/Debian/Ubuntu/

> > Ubuntu 10.04 to Ubuntu 21.04, C (programming language) only at the moment.

> Linux/Other

> > /x32/Android/

> > > Android 1.5 (Donut) to Android 4.4 (KitKat) - Java (programming language) only at the moment

> > /x64/Android/

> > > Android 5.0 (Lollipop) to Android 11.1 (Android R) - Java (programming language) only at the moment

Support for Fedora and other Linux distributions is currently coming soon

LIBrary/WebBrowsers

> Chromium

> > No specific Chromium version is available, as programs should follow WHATWG web standards, and not be platform specific.

> Gecko

> > No specific Gecko version is available, as programs should follow WHATWG web standards, and not be platform specific.

> WebKit

> > No specific WebKit version is available, as programs should follow WHATWG web standards, and not be platform specific.

> HTML5/WHATWG

> > This is a web standards compliant HTML5 application that is used for web browser application linking. It is ~92% certified at the moment.

LIBrary/Windows

> /10/

> Windows 10 build 1507 to Windows 10 build 2004

> > Available in C# and Java. Python, C, and other language support is currently coming soon

Those are all the software libraries at the moment.
